Official Fypeface
==================

In honor of the discovery of the Higgs boson particle, and my own personal preferences, the official typeface of this project is `Comic Sans`_.

.. _`Comic Sans`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Sans


Installation
============

Installing from PyPI::

    pip install that

Or if you want to try and play with the awesome source code::

Usage
======

From the Python shell::

    import that

Enjoy the wisdom!

Contributing
============

Clearly, the code that generates `THAT` is too straightforward. If you can make it better, then do so. Just don't do anything like add tests or document the code.
